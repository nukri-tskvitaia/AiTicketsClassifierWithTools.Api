# AI Ticket Classifier API

A lightweight ASP.NET Core Web API that uses Anthropic Claude to analyze customer support tickets and return structured AI-generated responses.

The API classifies tickets by category and priority, generates concise summaries, and creates professional suggested customer replies using Claude tool use with a predefined schema.

# Example Request

```json
{
  "message": "I forgot my password and cannot access my account."
}
```

# Example Response

```json
{
  "category": "Account",
  "priority": "High",
  "summary": "Customer cannot access their account due to a forgotten password.",
  "suggestedReply": "Hi, we can help you regain access to your account. Please click the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page to reset your password, or let us know if you need further assistance."
}
```

# Configuration

Store configuration securely using User Secrets or environment variables.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "Claude": {
    "ApiKey": "your_claude_api_key",
    "Version": "2023-06-01",
    "Model": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
    "MaxTokens": 700,
    "Temperature": 0.1,
    "MessagesEndpointUrl": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages"
  }
}
```

# Running the Project

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
```

## Navigate to project

```bash
cd AiTicketClassifier.Api
```

## Restore packages

```bash
dotnet restore
```

## Run the API

```bash
dotnet run
```

Swagger UI will open automatically.

# API Endpoint

## Analyze Ticket

```http
POST /api/tickets/analyze
```

---

# Validation

The application validates:

- Request model input
- Claude tool-use response structure
- Allowed categories
- Allowed priorities
- Required AI response fields
- DTO deserialization integrity

This helps ensure the API returns only valid structured responses even though LLM outputs are probabilistic by nature.

# Notes

This project demonstrates:

- AI API integration
- Claude tool use / function-calling style structured output
- Prompt engineering
- Schema-based AI response handling
- Backend validation techniques
- Production-oriented API design principles

The project intentionally keeps the architecture lightweight while applying clean and scalable engineering practices.
